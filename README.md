# Analysis and metric generation of climbing logs

## Context
You are logging your indoor climbing sessions for further analysis.  These logs only contain high-level information on which routes you climbed during the session, their order and the ascent type.  Ideally, these logs should be sufficient to generate meaningful performance metrics or actionable insights.

## Example of the data
The logs are currently containing the following information:

Date | Climbing gym | # in session | Route ID | Difficulty lvl | Send type | Style | Route info | # Blocks | # Falls | # Sends | Notes
---- | ------------ | ------------ | -------- | -------------- | --------- | ----- | ---------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | -----
14/11/2022 | XX | 1 | 1234 | 5.11d | Redpoint | Lead | Roof | 0 | 0 | 1 | Hard crux
